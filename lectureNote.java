/* Lecture 2 January 6th 
* file I/O
* Java tool: BlueJ;JDK plus text editor; Eclipse;
* semi-colon  (;) is for separate but not the new line and the space;
* i++ is means adding up 1 for i, int means integer --> for (int i = 1; i < n; i++ );
* dynamic typing: must run program to determine the types of expressions 
* java use static typing: declared with a type --> int x = 14;
* a variable must be declared before you use !! (the variable would not compile until you declare)
*
